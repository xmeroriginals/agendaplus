Welcome to AgendaPlus, User! Thank you for choosing us... You can synchronize your notes by logging into your account. Notes are limited to 1130 Characters and a Maximum of 15 Notes can be created (Total 16,950 characters), We limit them to give equal service to everyone in our completely free service and QR code sharing is made easier. Since the notes are encrypted, they become larger, we hope you understand... In case of any problem / error / security vulnerability, you can send an e-mail to our address “xmeroriginals@gmail.com” to contact us. Your notes are end-to-end encrypted and no one can access them, including us. If you lose the password key of your notes, you will not be able to recover your notes, it will be safest to store your password on paper or on your removable disk. Thank you.
